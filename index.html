        <h2 class="my-custom-class">How I got into amigurumi :0</h2>
        <p>I was first interested in amigurmi because I wanted a creative and fun way to make personalized handmade gifts.
            This hobby first kickstarted with me following YouTube tutorials to pickup on basic stitches. 
            I loved how crocheting gives me the ability to choose colors, patterns, and projects that aligned with my personal style.
            The repetitive nature of crocheting felt relaxing and meditative. Plus I could put on a show in the background while crocheting :D

    <div class="my-box">
        <h2 id="special-id">Did I also mention crocheting is 100% handmade?</h2>
        <p class="my-custom-class">Unlike knitting (which people often use interchangeably with crocheting) 
            there is no such thing as a crochet machine. Crochet requires variety of intricate stitches and frequent changes in 
            direction that machines are not able replicate the dexterity and precision of human hands.
            Machines are typically designed for linear and repetitive movements.
            Tension and flexibility of yarn is hard to replicate on machine. So for the above reasons, the art of crocheting 
            is a special skill to have and it is an incredibly rewarding experience to make something out of just a hook and a yarn by hand.
